    <h2 class="title is-2">If there's anything we stand for – it's quality.</h2>
    <p>Our mold-making compounds produce an extremly high-quality surface detail. Paragon Stone veneer surfaces are true-to-life, unlike the smooth or shiny characteristics found in many stones within the industry. Our stone veneer product is also notably lightweight without sacrificing thickness or strength.</p>
    <p>Give us a try, the quality and realism have to be seen to be believed.</p>

    <h2 class="title is-2">The right quality, the right value, the right service.</h2>
    <p>We're the Stone Guys™. We eat, breathe and live stones. With almost twenty years of experience we've seen a lot of companies come and go. We've also witnessed "quality" stones go bad. So we set out to create a company that set the standard of excellence. You see, we just don't provide a superior product, we provide a superior experience all around. Instinctively, you'll know you're dealing with a company who just "gets it."</p>
    <p>Paragon Stone keeps a well-stocked inventory on the ground for quick turnaround times and shipments on orders.</p>
