title: Ledgestone
description: >-
  The interplay of light and shadows dance across the walls in Paragon Stoneâ€™s
  Ledgestone. Roughly textured and varying in height, Ledgestone captures the
  drama of both subtle and bold ambient light. Nature inspired us to recreate
  this beautiful rock, now we hope it inspires your new creation.
